**1X Problem Solving (Technical Coding)**  
  
- Traditional coding interview completed through HackerRank. Our team will ask you to solve a problem, and will be looking for you to translate your solution into clean, well-structured code.  
- This will be focused on algorithms and data structures, but could vary depending on the interviewer and your experience.  
- They will be evaluating how you understand the problem and how fluent you are in your language of choice.   
- Both interviews are the same level, the only difference is the questions and the interviewers.  
  
**1X System Design (Technical Non-Coding)**   
  
- The interviewer will present a metrics/inference system design problem and will want you to break it down and design a scalable solution.  
- This is more like a brainstorming round; they want you to be able to break down the problem and see your higher level thinking/how you communicate or explain yourself.  
- The interviewer will evaluate your communication and decision making skills, and your ability to create a design that meets the problem’s requirements.  
- For this portion, you will have access to a virtual whiteboard via Hackerrank. No need to compile and run any code.  
  
**2X Personal Working Style (Behavioral)**  
  
- This interview will be focused on your personal working style and teamwork respectively.  
- Expect to do a deep dive into your interests, past projects, and experience. Your involvement and contributions to projects.   
- Collaboration and teamwork, examples of successful experiences working in a team or across other teams.  
- Prepare to talk through proposed scenarios/how you would react in different situations having to do with team collaboration.  
  
**General Interview Tips**  
  
- Communicate your thought process and reasoning as you’re going through a problem or doing a piece of analysis. Interact with the interviewer as you would a teammate.  
- Don’t be afraid to ask clarifying questions.  
- Be enthusiastic about Yelp and generally about working as a software engineer. It's fun to know what you are passionate about.  
- Each might ask you about your interest in Yelp and can help answer any questions that you might have (pending time).
