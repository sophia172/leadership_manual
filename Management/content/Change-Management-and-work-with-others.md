### Force field analysis    
    
Step 1: Define the change, or your goal, and place it in the centre.    
Step2: List the forces driving the change on the left.    
Step3: List the forces resisting change on the right.    
Step4: Rate the potential impact of each force form low to high.    
Step5: Compare the totals for driving change versus resisting change.    
Step6: Review all the force and rating.    
    
- You need to shift the balance of forces to facilitate change.    
- Communicate driving forces to redirect attention on the benefits of change.    
- Use decision tool such as Decision Tree analysis and cost benefit analysis to help identify more favourable solution, in order to improve scores for driving forces; lessen or remove some of the resisting forces.
