A simple way to ensure **clarity** and **focus** is to set a clear agenda in advance of your meeting.    
    
You should define the purpose of the meeting, a running list of actions or key topics for discussion, and outline expectations for contributions **in advance** to ensure all participants understand why they’re required and what they’re expected to prepare. It should then be used as a guide during the course of the meeting to focus attention in the right areas.    
    
**Set clear actions or objectives...**    
    
By defining and communicating the purpose of the meeting and key actions regarding each discussion point, you can ensure participants are able to focus their contributions appropriately. This is helpful in ensuring the meeting delivers maximum value.    
    
**Create a schedule of discussion points...**    
    
By creating a schedule for discussion points, you can set a more realistic time for the meeting and drive the pace more effectively. While a schedule can be flexible, it’s important to have one if you want to finish on time!    
    
**Define expectations...**    
    
By clarifying roles and responsibilities for participants in advance of the meeting, you can make sure everyone knows what they need to prepare. This helps to encourage engagement from the right people at the right times, and to minimise time wasted due to a lack of preparation.    
    
**Share the full attendee list...**    
    
By sharing a full list of attendees in advance, you can give people the chance to opt-out if they know they can be represented by someone else. We’ve all been in meetings we could have avoided if we’d known who else was planning to go.    
    
**Seek input from others...**    
    
By inviting input from participants before your agenda is finalised, you can ensure it accommodates everyone’s requirements (as appropriate). This helps to generate commitment to achieving an agreed set of actions.
