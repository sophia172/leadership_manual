## Structure of SWOT and case study



1. Check OT for PESTLE
2. Transfer key points from PESTLE to OT in SWOT.
3. Trying SW, some might fit the elements in 7S . It will help identify the SW. 

## [PESTLE analysis](obsidian://open?vault=Personal_Note_Library&file=Management%2Fform%2FSimplePESTLE.docx)(external for OT in SWOT)

### **Political**

Think about the political climate, tax, international trade agreements and restrictions, and the underlying issues that drive political agendas of the day.

- What is the scope of the politics that impact your business, based on your key markets, countries, and locations of your operations?
- What level of stability or volatility is present in these areas?
- What are the foreseeable political issues and how are theses being addressed by politicians and the media.

### **Economic** 

Gather key macro-economic data and consider these alongside local economic issues

- What are the forecasts in terms of exchange rates, economic growth, inflation and interest rates?
- How is consumer behaviour changing in your markets?
- How are labour markets behaving in your geographies, what are the labour costs, are key skills in ready supply or are there shortages?

### **Social**

Consider changes in social norms and behaviours, the cultural context could be changing in different ways in different areas or countries

- What demographic shifts, such as age and life situation, are observable in key stakeholder groups, such as customers and employees?
- How are social norms and attitudes changing?
- What changes are there in consumer behaviour?

### **Technological**

Identify the technologies that are driving change, and those that could disrupt the status quo.

- Which technologies are changing products and services in your industry and markets?
- Are there emerging technologies that currently seem unrelated, but you anticipate will have an indirect impact, or an impact in years to come?
- How are these technologies changing consumer behaviours?

### **Legal**

while this could be a subset of political factors, legislation has such a significant impact that it's worth considering separately.

- To what extent are your markets driven by legislative requirements and how could this change in the future?
- What key legislation drives your business processes and how might this change?
- Consider Health & Safety, Environmental legislation, Employment low and Data. What are the risks and issues that drive legislation?

### **Environmental**

Think about the impacts of your business on the environment, the normal supply of resources and lifecycle of products.

- What are the environmental impacts of your business in terms of carbon and waste, and the usage of energy and natural resources?
- What are the impacts of your industry as a whole, and your businesses supply chain?
- Are there any issues that would be difficult to deal with if exposed. 

### **How to use PESTLE**

#### SIMPLE WORKSHOP

Brainstorm the issues and gather data. If you do this in a group you can get the added benefit of bouncing ideas of each other and sharing views. This may be all you need for a temperature check of the business environment.

#### STRATEGIC PLAN OR BUSINESS PLAN

You could use PESTLE within a formal proposal or strategy document to record aspects of the wider environment that have informed your choices. You'will need to use other tools to understand the competitive position of the business, and you may need to gather data to back-up opinions. 

#### DETAILED STRATEGIC RISK ASSESSMENT

If the stakes are high, you can take your analysis to the next level by assessing the risks and opportunities of each of the issues you have identified. This is particularly appropriate if you are considering large investments, or making long-term decision.

The organisation needs to ask what's the SW in each area

### 7S
#### **Style:**

The characteristics of the organisation that make it easy or difficult for outsiders or new starters to settle. **Key question:** 

- how do senior leaders behave and set the tone

#### **Strategy** 

The strategy of your organisation is simply how it is planning to achieve its goals

**Key question:**

#### **Staff** 

This is about the people in your organisation

**Key question:**

- how engaged are the workforce? Is talent retention an issue? Are people offered relevant opportunities?
- Does the diversity of the workforce offer a range of perspectives

#### **Structure**

This is the organisation chart

**Key questions:**

- How do different business units and functions operate (centralised vs. decentralised, do they connect at high levels, or relatively junior levels)?
- How is authority cascaded through the organisation?

#### **Shared values**

This aligns with the branding and mission or vision of the organisation

**Key questions:**

- Most businesses exist to generate shareholder value, but does your organisation also have a community or social mission, which supports the brand?

#### **Skills**

This is an amalgamation of peoples' skills within the organisation

**Key questions:**

- What technical, professional and leadership skills exist within the organisation, including those gained through outsourcing.
- What overall organisational capabilities and knowledge exist, beyond the skills and experience of people?

#### **Systems** 

These are the processes that drive the organisation.

**Key questions:**

- How mature and adaptable are processes and systems across different functions?
