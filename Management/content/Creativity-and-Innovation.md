# 10 mental locks    
    
    
## The right answer    
    
From an early age, our minds are heavily socialised into categorising things into right and wrong. Our tendency to value coming up with the right answer as quickly as possible can stop us thinking harder to generate alternative ideas.    
    
**Break the lock for me**    
    
- Look for the right answer. Don’t be satisfied with the first obvious idea.    
- Ask a different question! Spend some time playing with the way you phrase the question. Write a few variations of your problem or opportunity statement.     
    
**Break the lock for others**    
    
- Ask what if and encourage lots of ideas rather than settling for the first right answer.     
- Encourage a playful team dynamic when it comes to generating ideas, and acknowledge effort in thinking creatively, not just the ideas themselves.    
## That’s not logical     
    
We must evaluate our creative thinking before we can turn our ideas into reality, but our minds often jump to this phase involuntarily. When we start to apply logical thinking , this can short-circuit your creative process.     
    
**Me**    
    
- become a poet during the imaginative phase. Don’t concern yourself with precise language, be playful with the words you use    
- Think of a metaphor to help you to explore the relationships between things. You could use sport, science or the natural world to give you a different perspective.     
    
**Others**    
    
- Try not to vocalise your thinking if it's focused on judgements or critical evaluation of what others are saying. Dedicate time to open thinking.     
- Encourage others to accept contradictions and ambiguity until you get past the creative thinking phase and into the action phase.     
## Follow the Rules    
    
The assumptions, processes and unwritten rule in our organisations and team cultures can stop us thinking about wider possibilities if we let them. Rules will limit creativity, sometimes without us even noticing.     
    
**Me**    
    
- Become a revolutionary. Identify the assumptions and rules that will govern your thinking if you let them and decide to ignore them for a time.     
- Think 'lazy', highlight the shortcuts you would take to avoid wasted effort, then check whether there are good reasons why shortcuts aren't appropriate.     
    
**Others**    
    
- Encourage others to identify the underlying assumptions and norms at work in your organisations.    
- Respond positively when others challenge the current way of working, thinking about the benefits of a new approach first before you reexplore your concerns.     
## Be Practical    
    
A great idea that isn't practical or workable now, can feel like a waste of time to explore. Our need to be practical encourages use to dismiss ideas that aren't obviously achievable without giving ourselves time to refine our thinking first.     
    
**Me**    
- Try to notice when you're thinking turns to judgement and critiquing, and pause before you act on it. Remember that this evaluation can happen later.    
- Let your unconscious mind dwell on issues of practicality for a while before eliminating and idea that has merit     
    
 **Others**    
- When someone starts to raise practical concerns, divert them back to clarifying the aim or the idea.    
- You could log practical concerns to go back to later. This will help to avoid the suggestion that you're ignoring the importance of being realistic.     
## Play is Frivolous    
    
Creativity often comes from our subconscious. If time is our enemy and we become too task focused, we don’t allow time to play with ideas and let them filter through.     
    
**Me**    
    
- If you focus on doing the same things efficiently, you don’t create opportunities to change and improve. Try thinking of a different approach    
- Find an outlet for your intuitive and unconscious thinking. Whether it's creative writing, drawing, or creating models, find the time to play with your thoughts.     
    
**Others**    
    
- Acknowledge and articulate the importance of innovation in your organisation and support the time and effort that goes into creative thinking    
- A relaxed and happy atmosphere is more conducive to creativity. Persistent pressure prevents creative thinking and pushes people to focus solely on the task at hand.     
## That's not my area    
    
If we don’t have expertise in an area it can be easy to leave the thinking to others, but this can create a narrow focus on technical rather than creative problem solving.     
    
**Me**    
    
- if you don’t understand the detail, this is a great opportunity to take a high-level view. You could offer a unique perspective and may find it easier to see the wood for the trees    
- Ask questions that help others to reframe their thinking. You don’t have to dominate a discussion to contribute to the flow of ideas.     
    
**Others**    
    
- Look out of colleagues or team members who seem to be remaining quiet and encourage them to share their perspective.     
- You need to be realistic - focussing on people with expertise is wise - but beware if they seem to narrow the focus.     
## Don’t be foolish    
    
We can become so preoccupied with our personal reputation that we don’t want to appear foolish, but our ego can prevent Tus from opening up and sharing our creativity    
    
**Me**    
    
- play the fool! .express your craziest idea and be prepared to laugh about tit. This can encourage others to be forthcoming with their ideas too     
- Be realistic though. If you are worried about feeling embarrassed be honest with yourself and dong put yourself in a situation you'll regret    
    
**Others**    
    
- Watch out for 'groupthink'.. If everyone agrees, you are not working creatively, just stating the obvious.     
- Encourage a safe environment in which people can laugh at themselves without feeling affronted.    
## Avoid Ambiguity    
    
A desire to make sense of the world an clarify our aims is a sensible starting point , but the harder we look , the more confusing, volatile and ambiguous things can seem. The need to avoid ambiguity can stop creativity in its tracks    
    
**Me**    
    
- Identifying ambiguity comes from an analytical mindset and a need to review and clarify. Try taking steps to progress your thinking, rather than refining ideas in the early stages    
- Use ambiguity to think of different scenarios. These can give you a new perspectives and add to your creative thinking    
    
**Others**    
    
- Ask what if  to encourage others to explore options and scenarios when things aren't clear    
- If people are struggling with ambiguity or perceived contradictions, just note them down and come back to them at a later phase.     
## To err is wrong    
    
We don’t like to fail, we learn early on that the easiest way to avoid failure is to play it safe. This can kill creativity early, as we focus on making minor adjustments to the status quo. Rather than thing in radically different ways.     
    
**Me**    
    
- As with most thing, failing effectively takes practice. Fail fast and often, by trying things out, then putting them down and moving on to the next one.     
- Ask yourself how successful you have been. If you have not experienced failure, then ask yourself how ambitious you have been , and whether you need to take more risks.    
    
**Other**    
    
- Recognise effort and learning from the things that don’t work as much as you celebrate delivering results.    
- Challenge short term easy wins. They can help generate momentum and confidence but can also distract people from responding to bigger issues that need creativity.     
    
## I am not creative    
    
A strange but common belief is that a creative is a certain type of person, and they cannot also be logical, practical , or have other professional characteristics we value. This is based on prejudice, not evidence.     
    
**Me**     
    
- We are socialised to value creativity in niche areas of our lives, our hobbies, the arts, but we create every time we make something.     
- Neuroscience tells us our brain change with experiences, so kick-start your creativity by trying something new, adapt a recipe, doodle, write a journal.     
    
**Others**    
    
- Lead by example - put your ideas and creative insights out there and ask others to contribute. Reduce the feeling of risk by sharing ideas without getting emotionally attached to them.     
- Encourage the early signs of creativity, whether it's simple the language people use, or a whole new idea. Focus on supporting creative practice, rather than worrying about outputs.
