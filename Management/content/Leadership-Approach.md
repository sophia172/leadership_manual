## Instruct  
  
The instructive style is highly directive and doesn't offer much in the way of support. It's generally more appropriate for individuals with low levels of competence and high levels of commitment where someone wants to complete a task, but does not know how. It's less appropriate of those who are less committed or more competent/confident. As it can come across as patronising and controlling.  
  
## Advice  
  
Advice is highly directive and highly supportive which is generally more appropriate for those with low or varying levels of competence and lower levels of commitment. It’s less appropriate for individuals who have the knowledge and skills they need, as  lower levels of commitment. It’s less appropriate for individuals who have the knowledge and skills they need, as it doesn't encourage them to develop their own problem-solving capability.   
  
## Coaching  
  
  
It's important for both **coach** and **coaches** to understand the role of a coach so they know what to expect, both in terms of what they're likely to **get out** of the experience and what they'll need to **put in**.  
## Delegate   
  
When a task is delegated, little to no direction or support is provided regarding how it should be completed, so this is only appropriate for individuals with high levels of competence and commitment to/confidence in a task. It's less appropriate where support is still required to guide and develop problem-solving capability.

### 4Cs of Coaching  
  
- **Clarity**  
  
If someone is unclear about what is required of them, coaching can offer the clarity they need  
  
- **Capability**  
  
If someone is unable to achieve their goals, coaching can drive development of capability through questioning.  
  
- **commitment**  
  
If someone's desire to achieve their goals is lacking, a coaching approach can help them to explore the reasons why and identify possible solutions.  
  
- **Confidence**  
  
If someone lacks the confidence to do what they need to perform, a coaching approach can help them explore the reasons why and identify alternative options.  
  
### Coaching models  
  
#### Grow  
- Goal  
    - Should be  
        - A clear vision of the future  
        - SMART-Specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, timebound  
    - Should not be  
        - Just a problem statement about a current state, it must clarify how the future should be different.  
- Reality  
    - Should be   
        - A realistic analysis the present situation  
        - An understanding of the gap between the current and future states  
    - Shouldn't be  
        - A list of barriers or excuses that erode self-belief or empowerment  
- Options  
    - Should be  
        - Possible actions and approaches which could move the person towards the goal  
        - About finding realistic opportunities and removing obstacles to success  
    - Shouldn't be  
        - An opportunity of the coach to tell the individual what to do  
- Will  
    - Should be  
        - A clear way forward, again using SMART objectives  
        - A prioritisation of actions that will have the biggest impact  
        - An opportunity to check the individuals personal motivation and belief  
    - Should not be  
        - An opportunity of the coach to tell the individual what to do.   
- **TIPS**  
    - Pace  
        - In any one coaching converstion you may work all the way through the 4 stages of GROW, or it may take a few sessions to complete a single stage. There is not right pace  
    - Frequency  
        - As leaders and managers we can use GROW for just a minute a t time, and take several days to complete all four stages. You have the opportunity to flex the frequency.  
    - Reflection  
        - GROW can be used continuously by planning time to review progress of options and will, and to reflect on the goal and reality. If things hcange, simply work through the steps again.  
#### Fast  
- Focused  
	- Effective, informal coaching conversations should remain focused on dealing with the issue raised by the individual, to support the problem-solving process and deliver rapid results.  
- Action-orientated  
	- Informal coaching conversations should be action-orientated, with the aim of enabling the individual to identify clear next steps  
- Solution-focused  
	- Informal coaching conversation should be focused on identifying solutions for a clearly defined problem, so less time should be given to the problem than to the solution.  
- Timely  
	- Given the problem-solving focus, informal coaching conversations should take place on the spot, at the point of need. The aim should be to provide rapid support which helps to keep things moving.  
  
### Great Coaching Questions...  
  
What make s a great coaching question?  
- it's simple  
- it has purpose  
- it will be influencing without controlling  
  
Useful question types include:  
  
**What -** e.g. What is happening right now?  
**How -** e.g. How would you like it to be different?  
**When -** e.g. When do you feel mor e engaged in your work?   
**Where -** e.g. Where does the workload feel most manageable?  
  
### Questions to Avoid…  
  
Try to avoid **complex**, **leading**, **rhetorical**, **multi-layered**, **ambiguous** or **controlling** questions, as they're unlikely to offer the level of clarity or focus required for deeper reflective thinking.  
  
'**Why**' questions may seem appropriate when you're exploring an issue in detail, but this type of question can seem ambiguous, be too open-ended and make people feel defensive. Simpler, more focussed questions are likely to be more effective.  
  
### Listening skills  
  
#### Type A Listening  
  
This is listening for the content of what a coachee is saying. For example the facts and reality of a situation. By applying some of the simple techniques below, an effective Coach can build rapport and explore the content of what the coachee is saying.  
  
- Match their body language  
- Match their voice tone  
- Encouraging  
- Clarifying  
- Summarising  
- Reflecting  
- Empathising  
  
#### Type B Listening  
  
This is listening for deeper meaning. It focusses on additional cues we give others to show that we're listening. By applying some of the simple techniques below, an effective Coach can build rapport and develop the trust required to enable the Coachee to discuss their experiences openly.  
  
The types of cues that you might look out for are:  
  
- The energy the person is showing and how it changes  
- The beliefs they hold about themselves  
- The values they are displaying  
- The emotion that surrounds the content  
- The personality clues  
- The atmosphere that is present  
- The information their body is offering

### Summary  
  
Coaching, as a leadership style, is a great way to empower others to take ownership of their performance, by guiding them through the problem-solving process.  
  
1. 1A Coach doesn't provide the answers but uses **powerful questions** and **deep listening** techniques to guide the Coachee towards their own solutions.  
2. Coaching is particularly suited to experienced and competent individuals with, potentially, varying levels of commitment - **remember:** the coachee has the answers!  
3. Effective coaching aims to build the clarity, capability, commitment, and **confidence** an individual requires to achieve their immediate or long-term goals.  
  
## Give feedback  
  
  
We usually give feedback to help someone appreciate their actions from a different perspective. This lets them know how they are doing and can help them in choosing how to do things differently. Feedback can be immensely valuable, but how do we ensure that it achieves the desired effect?  
  
Structuring your feedback by describing the **Action**, considering the **Impacts** and then relating them to the **Desired outcome**, can ensure that your perspective is clearly communicated - giving the recipient a clear action and enhanced motivation.  
  
### The AID Model  
  
The **AID model** is a simple but effective tool to help you structure your feedback and make sure it is relevant and easily understood.  
  
- Action  
	- What did the person actually do  
	- How did they perform  
	- Was anything done particularly well or particularly badly?  
- Impact  
	- What's the impact of the action  
	- How did it affect relevant stakeholders  
	- Was this desirable or undesirable  
- Desired outcome/do differently  
	- What should happen going forwards?  
	- How can this be achieved?  
	- What could be done differently in the future  
  
**Keep it positive!** Remember, when giving negative feedback, people respond better when it's 'sandwiched' between positive statements. As a rule of thumb, a minimum ratio would be**3:1** (3 positive statements for 1 negative), however, it could be as many as **7:1**.

When giving feedback, think about the AID model and structure what you say to cover: the **Action** you're talking about; the **Impact** of that action; and the **Desired outcome** that you're looking to achieve. This will help to ensure that the feedback is relevant and easy to understand.
