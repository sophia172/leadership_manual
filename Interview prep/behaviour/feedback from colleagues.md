  
they love to work with me, it feel more passionate to work in a project i am managing.   
They also like it they can get career advice from me. helping direction what they want to achieve careerwise.  
  
Spend too long in a particular task or details an. So  I set up an alarm on each task. If I work on it for too long, I need to take a break and look back to see what went wrong. If I need to take alternative way or just stop there.
