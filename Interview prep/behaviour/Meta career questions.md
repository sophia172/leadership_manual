Hello Jerry. Can I please ask what kind of project you are working on within meta. And I would like to ask whether the role "Software Engineer, Machine Learning" will have research or R&D components. My research expertise sits in few-shot learning, adding adaptor to legacy AI system for user customisation. My daily work is related to developing model for time-series sensor signal and apply the model to edge device. I am wondering if there is projects which I can fully utilise my skillset. Best wishes Ying

Some teams are more bottoum up, independant solution adn design, some team are top down adn they have clear goal.   
  
genral requiremnt from meta to make model smaller and better.  
  
  
There is a need for model compression, in generative model, CV model:  
model parallellation, mention it in interview.  provide reasonable and comprehensive design.   
soem ask you to draw the database. testing in depth and width. cover some of my research can impress the interviewers. collect right data.  
  
meta team has the issue of big model.   
integrating team   
xr/genrative has large CV model.

Dear Ali Thank you for the connection opportunity. Can I please ask you about the project you are working in. What kind of skill you find most valuable in your SW managing career? Do you see someone managing small team of maximum 3 with background in startup capable of the managing work in meta? What would you say as the most important features when you recruit someone for a E5/6 level. Looking forward to talking to you. Best wishes Ying
