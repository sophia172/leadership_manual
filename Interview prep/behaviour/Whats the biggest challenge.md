One of the challenge I faced was about incompatible ML model for a MCU.  
  
    
  
I was managing a project where I need to deliver a Hardware using microcontroller, a ML model which need to be deployed on the microcontroller, an UI to showcase the result.   
  
    
  
The task of this ML model is to deliver about  480 float numbers every second. The model use CNN-LSTM structure is too big for the existing microcontrollers.   
  
I test several model compression method including quantisation,  
  
    
  
I grouped up every team members on the tech side to have a brain storm of potential solution. Electric Engineer says they can weld more memories, Firmware engineer says to change MCU to a bigger one, ML engineer says quantise the model to about 25%, .   
  
    
  
Considering the deadline and feasibility each solution, I settled on a combination solution of model quantization, add memories to microcontroller. I also asked one team member to source for another MCU as the backup plan. At that time, we do not know if any would work. I pushed for quick iteration. We found the quantised model is still too big for the MCU with more memories. In the end, we went for the back up plan which is changing the MCU.   
  
    
  
    
  
The good part about brain storm is that, everyone who involved in this would support the solution because it’s a group effect. It’s also a type of motivation during the long process of one project.   
  
    
  
From this challenge, I find it so much faster to have a brain storm than asking everyone separately. Because we can decline so many unfeasible solution because everyone knows part of the work and they can spot the problem immediately.   
  
  
  
  
  
  
feedback:  
they love to work with me, it feel more passionate to work in a project i am managing
