Meta is a world leading company in the Machine Learning research field, especially the computer vision part in the Fair team. The recent work about high quality 3d reconstruction is very impressive. Since this field is going so fast, there is urgent demand of moving these algorithm to a lower-powered device such as headset or wearable equipment.   
  
    
  
My work in the past few years are focusing on adding model adaptor on top of a large and expensive model. So they are suitable for low-power device such as Microcontrollers. The adaptor is cheap and small but can be very efficient in tuning the general model for customisation pUrpose. Because they are so small, they can be used in a lot of hardwares. I believe my skillset would expand meta’s knowledge base in a lot of projects, especially within the FAIR team.  
  
    
  
At the same time, I align with meta’s value which is move fast and build awesome things. I want to be in such an environment that the team can make something big and different for the future.
