	I was working on a project to design a gesture recognition system for hand controllers. I want to add a error corrector on top of this gesture recognition model since it's light so I can increase the accuracy and maintain the current latency in the gesture recognition system.  
  
- T   
	I was passionate to apply this innovative algorithm. I spent about a month on it, did the off-line evaluation on the existing dataset which i processed and the corrector achieved >99% accuracy. I find it really odd and too good to be true.   
   
- A   
	So I went back to check my dataset and my code. It turns out the label i assigned to the dataset for the error corrector was wrong. I had to rewrite data processing part. It was a lot of time wasted to do the repeating work  
  
- R  
	I had to rewrite data processing part. It was a lot of time wasted to do the repeating work. Since then, Everytime i write a code, I made sure it could be purposed for multiple tasks. If I made a mistake in a early stage such as the dataset, I do not need to modify the code anymore so it is more efficient.
