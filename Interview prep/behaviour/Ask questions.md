  
1. Do we have enough data? Do we have enough label?  
2. Is the data **[imbalanced](../System%20Design/Data%20engineering.md#class%20imbalance%20problem)**?  
3. What is the input data like? â€”> what solution do you have for small amount of data and large amount of data.   
4. what is the minimum requirement for accuracy and performance  
5. what is the traffic and bandwidth like?  
6. What is the computational resources and constrains. Any possibility of future expansion. Prepare for future scalability.
