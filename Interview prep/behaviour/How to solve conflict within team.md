I understand that you want me to explain how I solved a conflict within the team. I can start talking about in a high level. I also have detailed example later if you want to hear about that.   
  
  
A degree of conflict is inevitable in any team or organisation. As a leader or manager, handling conflict within your team is a key skill that can help to ensure your team continues to be effective, and relationships between individuals remain healthy and productive. Following these suggestions will help you to take action effectively if conflict occurs in your team.  
  
Create a positive working environment  
  
Conflict is less likely to occur in positive working cultures where mutual trust and respect abound. You can create this kind of environment by treating everyone in your team fairly and equally, providing them with praise and recognition, and being open and honest at all times.  
  
Learn to spot the signs of conflict  
  
Although they are often quite subtle, you can start to detect the signs of conflict simply by being aware of the interactions within your team. Conflict might be reflected in team members’ body language (e.g. crossed arms, leaning away from the person they’re talking to), facial expressions (e.g. frowning, gazing down or into the distance), or tone of voice.  
  
Deal with conflict as soon as it occurs  
  
Conflict is usually borne out of small annoyances or disagreements that can be easily resolved when addressed early. However, if ignored, these seemingly small issues can quickly escalate and prevent the individuals from working effectively together. If you notice conflict between your team members, it is extremely important to take action and help them resolve the situation before it spirals out of control.  
  
Set some ground rules for discussing conflict  
  
If you become aware of conflict between team members, it is a good idea to bring them together to talk about the problem. Before getting the conversation underway, set some ground rules. Team members should listen to one another, respect one another’s points of view, and refrain from interrupting each other. The tone of the conversation should be calm, rational and non-threatening. It is therefore important for team members not to engage in this kind of discussion if they are feeling angry or emotional.  
  
Don’t take sides  
  
Even if you feel as though you empathise or agree with one individual in particular, it is important that you remain objective while discussing conflict between team members. Your role is to help the team members address the issues causing the conflict and to reach a resolution that works well for both of them.  
  
Seek advice and guidance  
  
If you are faced with a complex or challenging conflict situation in your team and are unsure how to handle it, seek some support before taking action. You may wish to consult your line manager or a trusted colleague who is particularly adept at handling conflict. Your HR department (if you have one) may also be able to provide you with help and support in this regard.  
  
Develop your team’s conflict management skills  
  
It is important for team members to understand conflict and feel confident about resolving situations independently. To this end, you may wish to liaise with your Learning and Development department to discuss the possibility of offering conflict management skills training to the team or wider organisation. You might also wish to explore the possibility of introducing conflict management as a core competency in your organisation with the help of the appropriate individuals (e.g. your HR department or line manager).  
  
Evaluate your conflict management skills  
  
After handling a conflict situation in your team, spend some time reflecting on how effectively you did this. Consider what you did well, as well as what you might wish to do differently in the future. Make a note of these observations, so you can refer to them next time you are required to handle conflict within your team. You might also find it helpful to solicit some  
  
feedback from the team members involved to find out how effective they felt you were at helping them resolve the

# Example  
  
One of the conflict is regarding a technical problems in the project.   
  
There is a problem in the data and we cannot trace the source of the problem, I grouped everyone involved to figure out where the problem is coming from. The brain storming turned slightly into a scenario of “This is not problem from my section and this is your fault” because no one understand what the problem is.  
When I noticed when the meeting is going on without a solution. I stopped the conversation. And follow the procedure of conflict management.   
I said that none of us know what is going on with this problem, But we all want to fix it as soon as possible, so why not everyone suggest something to test, like a debug process, we are going to  turn them into tasks and we are going to finish it one by one if everyone is ok with this.   
I will talk with other project managers to make sure we all have time for this since everyone is working on multiple projects.    
  
  
So I have about 5-6 suggestions, and each person pick the tasks they are comfortable with. I updated the result on the channel to make sure everyone is updated with it. After that meeting, I had 2 private meetings with two members who were quite strong minded during the conversation to make sure they agree with the solution.   
  
The problem is identified in the end.   
What I learnt from it is that, the most important thing, for me, is to identify the conflict as soon as possible. It could be easily resolved following a standard procedure before everyone gets personal feelings involved.
