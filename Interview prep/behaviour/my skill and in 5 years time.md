**Tell me the skills you can offer, tell me where you will be in 5 years.**   
  
On top of my coding skill. I can offer my knowledge about building ml project  architecture, my research knowledge about agile ml inference and my leadership skills.   
  
I built end-to-end ML projects from data collection to hardware deployment, then giving demos to stakeholder. I have finished two big projects and currently working on new ones. It proves my coding skills which can support the whole project from end to end.   
  
    
  
I also have one paper published on IJCNN, one submitted to ECCV and another one submitted to a journal. These work are about ML algorithm which focuses on model adaptor. They are small and cheap so we do not need to retrain the legacy AI system. These research work would showcase my ML knowledge.   
  
    
  
I am currently the head of AI in a startup with 2 other colleagues working with me. I offer 121 meetings, guild them through projects. I am also the director of women who code which is a volunteering organisation to inspire women to thrive in the tech world. I am currently mentoring two members within the organisation. These should be good enough to prove my leadership skills.   
  
    
  
I want to publish 5 papers in 5years. Get to principle ML researcher role. Have one project facing the market.
