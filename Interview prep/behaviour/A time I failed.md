I would describe it as the time I didn’t deliver something which is not up to my expectation.   
  
It was a project I was working on. I need to deliver an algorithm to calculate walking distance from Inertial Measure Unit data. This is pure software engineer and nothing about ML.   
  
    
  
I did not even know what the IMU is when I started and I need to deliver the feature in 3 weeks. I was quite stressed at that time. The IMU is a sensor which has so Many configurations I do not understand and it didnot give me clean data to start with.  
  
So I started to learn the whole thing about IMU and try to understand the configuration for that hardware so I can use the data and tune the data from configuration so it is cleaner. It took me a few days to learn the whole navigation system which is what the IMU is based on, and another week or two to read through the manual to have a rough idea. It was not until later, I realised I can contact the manufacture techs support of the best configuration.  
  
    
  
In the end, I manage to deliver the function with a measurement of distance. But the result is not as accurate as what I want it to be.   
  
After that, I start to get familiar with all the sensors which are in the market and learnt about the basic theories of it. so I wont jump into something
