Traditional regression methods in machine learning are designed to predict continuous outcomes. These methods vary in complexity and applicability depending on the dataset characteristics and the nature of the problem. Here are some widely used traditional regression algorithms:  
  
### 1. Linear Regression  
  
**Overview:**  
- The simplest form of regression, modeling the relationship between the dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) using a linear equation.  
  
**How it Works:**  
- Fits a line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) to the data by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values (least squares method).  
  
**Strengths:**  
- Simple and interpretable.  
- Computationally efficient.  
- Works well with linearly related data.  
  
**Limitations:**  
- Assumes a linear relationship between features and target.  
- Sensitive to outliers.  
- Cannot capture complex patterns.  
  
### 2. Polynomial Regression  
  
**Overview:**  
- An extension of linear regression that models the relationship between the target and features as an nth-degree polynomial.  
  
**How it Works:**  
- Transforms the original features into polynomial features of a specified degree and then applies linear regression.  
  
**Strengths:**  
- Can model non-linear relationships.  
  
**Limitations:**  
- Higher degrees can lead to overfitting.  
- Increased computational complexity with higher-degree polynomials.  
  
### 3. Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)  
  
**Overview:**  
- A type of linear regression that includes a regularization term to prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients.  
  
**How it Works:**  
- Adds the L2 penalty term (\(\lambda \sum \beta_j^2\)) to the loss function to shrink the coefficients.  
  
**Strengths:**  
- Reduces overfitting.  
- Handles multicollinearity better than ordinary linear regression.  
  
**Limitations:**  
- The penalty term must be tuned (e.g., via cross-validation).  
  
### 4. Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)  
  
**Overview:**  
- Similar to ridge regression, but uses an L1 penalty to enforce sparsity, potentially leading to feature selection.  
  
**How it Works:**  
- Adds the L1 penalty term (\(\lambda \sum |\beta_j|\)) to the loss function, encouraging some coefficients to be exactly zero.  
  
**Strengths:**  
- Performs feature selection by shrinking some coefficients to zero.  
- Can handle multicollinearity.  
  
**Limitations:**  
- The penalty term must be tuned.  
- Can be computationally intensive with large datasets.  
  
### 5. Elastic Net Regression  
  
**Overview:**  
- Combines L1 and L2 regularization to benefit from both ridge and lasso regression.  
  
**How it Works:**  
- Adds both L1 and L2 penalty terms to the loss function (\(\lambda_1 \sum |\beta_j| + \lambda_2 \sum \beta_j^2\)).  
  
**Strengths:**  
- Balances between ridge and lasso, providing a more flexible regularization approach.  
- Can handle multicollinearity and perform feature selection.  
  
**Limitations:**  
- Two penalty terms need to be tuned.  
  
### 6. Support Vector Regression (SVR)  
  
**Overview:**  
- An extension of support vector machines (SVM) for regression tasks, aiming to find a function within a specified margin of error.  
  
**How it Works:**  
- Fits the data points within a margin (epsilon-tube) and penalizes deviations outside this margin using support vectors.  
  
**Strengths:**  
- Effective in high-dimensional spaces.  
- Robust to outliers.  
  
**Limitations:**  
- Computationally intensive.  
- Requires careful tuning of parameters (e.g., kernel, epsilon, regularization parameter).  
  
### 7. Decision Trees  
  
**Overview:**  
- A non-linear regression model that splits the feature space into regions and fits a simple model (e.g., constant value) in each region.  
  
**How it Works:**  
- Recursively splits the data based on feature values, minimizing a loss function (e.g., mean squared error) at each node.  
  
**Strengths:**  
- Can capture non-linear relationships.  
- Easy to interpret.  
  
**Limitations:**  
- Prone to overfitting.  
- Sensitive to small changes in the data.  
  
### 8. Random Forest Regression  
  
**Overview:**  
- An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions.  
  
**How it Works:**  
- Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data and features, and the final prediction is the average of all tree predictions.  
  
**Strengths:**  
- Reduces overfitting compared to a single decision tree.  
- Handles large datasets and high-dimensional spaces well.  
  
**Limitations:**  
- Less interpretable than individual decision trees.  
- Can be computationally intensive.  
  
### 9. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)  
  
**Overview:**  
- An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, with each new model correcting the errors of the previous ones.  
  
**How it Works:**  
- Fits a new decision tree to the residuals of the previous model's predictions, combining the models to minimize the overall loss.  
  
**Strengths:**  
- High accuracy and robustness.  
- Can handle different types of data and capture complex patterns.  
  
**Limitations:**  
- Computationally intensive.  
- Sensitive to hyperparameters and can overfit without proper tuning.  
  
### 10. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Regression  
  
**Overview:**  
- A non-parametric method that predicts the target value based on the average of the k-nearest neighbors in the feature space.  
  
**How it Works:**  
- Finds the k closest data points to the query point and averages their target values.  
  
**Strengths:**  
- Simple and intuitive.  
- Effective with sufficient representative data.  
  
**Limitations:**  
- Computationally expensive for large datasets.  
- Performance depends on the choice of k and distance metric.  
  
### Summary  
  
Each traditional regression algorithm has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which to use depends on the specific characteristics of the problem and data at hand. Practitioners often experiment with multiple algorithms and use techniques like cross-validation to select the best-performing model for their specific use case.
