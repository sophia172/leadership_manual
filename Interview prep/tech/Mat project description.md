# Situation  
This project needs to deliver a pressure sensing mat prototype. Not only, it senses the high resolution pressure map when a person is stepping on it. it also need to evaluate this person's pose and show it on the UI.  This project involves a cross function collaboration among hardware design, electronic engineer, firmware engineer, UI engineer and ML engineer.  I was working as the project lead as well as the ML engineer within the team.   
  
This is a R&D project funded by innovate UK. hence, apart from the team, our stake holder include innovate UK and collaborative universities.   
  
# Task/Problem  
The scope of this project is to design a ML software solution to transfer 2D pressure map to 3D body coordinates.   
There is a design of everything.   
  
  
  
  
# Impact  
This project gives a business impact, As we have a demonstrable prototype and less competitor.  It drew 200% increase in the b2b projects.   
Cross-functional team impact: a lot of technical problems which are available for other projects. such as   
  
Social impact: This mat was designed as a prototype but the application can go from gaming, fitness to medtech. In the gaming market. it could be used in the virtual reality, in fitness, it could do things like Yoga or training procedure. In medtech, it has the potential with stroke detection from pose estimation of   
  
personal impact, help team members with their career developement and passionate about their work.   
  
# Action  
  
  
project planing: swim lane process mapping,   
				clear miletone,   
				clear delivables.   
Because the project is long term, team member loose motivation, I designed the demo day to present our work within the team, emphase the project impact and scope.
