Multi-Head Self-Attention is a core component of the Transformer architecture, including the Vision Transformer (ViT). It enables the model to focus on different parts of the input simultaneously and capture complex dependencies. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how Multi-Head Self-Attention works:  
  
### 1. Self-Attention Mechanism  
  
#### Steps in Self-Attention:  
  
1. **Input Embeddings:**  
   - Given an input sequence of vectors (embeddings), $X = [x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n]$, where $x_i$ is the embedding of the $i$-th token (or patch in the case of ViT).  
  
2. **Linear Projections:**  
   - Three different linear projections (matrices) are applied to the input to obtain the Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) matrices.  
    $$  
     Q = XW^Q, \quad K = XW^K, \quad V = XW^V  
    $$  
   - Here, $W^Q$, $W^K$, and $W^V$ are learnable weight matrices.  
  
3. **Scaled Dot-Product Attention:**  
   - Compute the dot product of the Query and Key matrices to get the attention scores.  
    $$  
     \text{Attention\_scores} = QK^T  
    $$  
   - Scale the scores by the square root of the dimensionality of the Key vectors, $d_k$, to stabilize gradients.  
    $$  
     \text{Scaled\_scores} = \frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}  
    $$  
   - Apply a softmax function to obtain the attention weights.  
    $$  
     \text{Attention\_weights} = \text{softmax}\left( \frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right)  
    $$  
   - Multiply the attention weights by the Value matrix to get the output of the self-attention mechanism.  
    $$  
     \text{Attention\_output} = \text{Attention\_weights} \times V  
    $$  
  
### 2. Multi-Head Mechanism  
  
Instead of performing a single attention function, Multi-Head Self-Attention runs multiple attention mechanisms in parallel. This allows the model to capture information from different representation subspaces at different positions.  
  
#### Steps in Multi-Head Self-Attention:  
  
1. **Multiple Heads:**  
   - Perform the above self-attention mechanism $h$ times (where $h$ is the number of heads) with different learned linear projections.  
   - This results in multiple sets of Q, K, and V matrices: $Q_i, K_i, V_i$ for each head $i$.  
  
2. **Concatenation:**  
   - Each head produces its own attention output, resulting in $h$ different outputs.  
   - Concatenate these outputs to form a single tensor.  
    $$  
     \text{MultiHead\_output} = \text{concat}(\text{head}_1, \text{head}_2, \ldots, \text{head}_h)  
    $$  
  
3. **Final Linear Projection:**  
   - Apply a final linear projection to the concatenated output to obtain the final multi-head attention result.  
    $$  
     \text{Output} = \text{MultiHead\_output}W^O  
    $$  
   - Here, $W^O$ is another learnable weight matrix.  
  
### Summary of the Workflow  
  
1. **Input Embeddings:** $X = [x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n]$  
2. **Linear Projections:**  
  $$  
   Q = XW^Q, \quad K = XW^K, \quad V = XW^V  
  $$  
3. **Attention Scores:**  
  $$  
   \text{Attention\_scores} = \frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}  
  $$  
4. **Attention Weights:**  
  $$  
   \text{Attention\_weights} = \text{softmax}\left( \frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right)  
  $$  
5. **Attention Output:**  
  $$  
   \text{Attention\_output} = \text{Attention\_weights} \times V  
  $$  
6. **Multi-Head Attention:**  
   - Perform the above for each head.  
   - Concatenate the outputs.  
   - Apply a final linear projection.  
  
### Implementation in Code (Simplified Pseudocode)  
  
Here's a simplified implementation in a PyTorch-like pseudocode:  
  
```python  
import torch  
import torch.nn as nn  
  
class MultiHeadSelfAttention(nn.Module):  
    def __init__(self, embedding_dim, num_heads):  
        super(MultiHeadSelfAttention, self).__init__()  
        self.num_heads = num_heads  
        self.head_dim = embedding_dim // num_heads  
  
        self.query_linear = nn.Linear(embedding_dim, embedding_dim)  
        self.key_linear = nn.Linear(embedding_dim, embedding_dim)  
        self.value_linear = nn.Linear(embedding_dim, embedding_dim)  
        self.out_linear = nn.Linear(embedding_dim, embedding_dim)  
  
    def forward(self, x):  
        batch_size, seq_length, embedding_dim = x.size()  
          
        # Linear projections  
        Q = self.query_linear(x)  
        K = self.key_linear(x)  
        V = self.value_linear(x)  
          
        # Reshape to (batch_size, num_heads, seq_length, head_dim)  
        Q = Q.view(batch_size, seq_length, self.num_heads, self.head_dim).transpose(1, 2)  
        K = K.view(batch_size, seq_length, self.num_heads, self.head_dim).transpose(1, 2)  
        V = V.view(batch_size, seq_length, self.num_heads, self.head_dim).transpose(1, 2)  
  
        # Scaled dot-product attention  
        scores = torch.matmul(Q, K.transpose(-2, -1)) / torch.sqrt(torch.tensor(self.head_dim, dtype=torch.float32))  
        attention_weights = torch.nn.functional.softmax(scores, dim=-1)  
        attention_output = torch.matmul(attention_weights, V)  
  
        # Concatenate heads and apply final linear projection  
        attention_output = attention_output.transpose(1, 2).contiguous().view(batch_size, seq_length, embedding_dim)  
        output = self.out_linear(attention_output)  
          
        return output  
  
# Example usage  
embedding_dim = 768  
num_heads = 12  
self_attention = MultiHeadSelfAttention(embedding_dim, num_heads)  
x = torch.randn(1, 196, embedding_dim)  # Batch size of 1, sequence length 196 (e.g., patches), embedding_dim 768  
output = self_attention(x)  
print(output.shape)  # Should be (1, 196, 768)  
```  
  
### Conclusion  
  
Multi-Head Self-Attention allows the model to capture various types of information from different parts of the input sequence simultaneously, making it highly effective for both NLP and computer vision tasks. It enhances the model's ability to understand complex patterns and relationships within the data.
